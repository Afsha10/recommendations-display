# recommendations-tracker

## Business problem:
People recommend things (books, TV shows, music etc). Sometimes we don't get around to trying them out for a while. We want a website to track those recommendations, and to help us pick things when we're in the right mood for them.

## User roles
We will make a single-user website, with exactly one expected user:
- Collector - someone who receives recommendations, and want to log and track them.

## User stories
- As a collector, I can save a recommendation, including at least the following information:
    * What the thing being recommended is
    * Who made the recommendation
    * What medium of the recommendation is (e.g. book, TV show, movie, ...)
    * The mood of the recommendation (e.g. upbeat / scary / thoughtful / ...)
        - one recommendation may have multiple moods!
